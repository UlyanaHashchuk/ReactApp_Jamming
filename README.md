This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Info

This "Jamming" application was created as the finale project of "Web Development" path, section "Building Front-end Applications with React" by codecademy.com. In this project I used my knowledge of React class components and state. By using the Spotify API in this React web application users can search the Spotidy library, create playlists by adding "+" songs from search result(or removing "-" songs form playlist) and save their new playlist directly to Spotify account.
